## Nerd's thinking
### Gains:
- Another example for React-Saga to handle API 
- It could be made as a multi-paged app, however I decided to consolidate it into one single-page-app in the case of convenience 
- React-Toastify is amazing and easy to use for notification 

### Pains:
- In the first version, there was no indication if the player made the correct selection which hurt the user's experience badly 
- In the second version, I added the selection result indication with react-toastify 
- A review of all answered questions would be helpful and more interesting to users, which can be added in the following version (Added) 

## Languages:
- React 
- React-Redux 
- React-Saga 
- React-Toastify
